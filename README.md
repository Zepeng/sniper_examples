# sniper_examples
Three simple examples to demonstrate use of Data Models in nexo-sniper.
SNiPER framework is necessary to run the code.

Ex1: create_simevent
This example is to show the use of SimEvent data model. The code reads data from general ROOT file produced in nEXO_MC simulation, then stores them in a ROOT file of SimEvent class defined in nexo-sniper data model. This example also shows data management in SNiPER.

Ex2: read_simevent
This example is similar to Ex1. It shows how to read SimEvent in ROOT file.

Ex3: ChargeRecon
This example shows the use of ElecEvent data model.
